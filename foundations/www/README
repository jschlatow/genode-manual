Instructions
============

To build the www version of the manual,

# Generate the spec/class_index.mk file by using the following command from
  within the manual/spec directory:

  ! make class_index.mk

  This step scans the Genode API for the list of classes. This information
  is later used to assemble the content of the "Functional Specification"
  chapter of the book.

# Generate the HTML files for the book by issueing 'make' from within the
  _www/_-directory.

# The generated HTML files reside at the _www/html/_ directory. The table
  of contents is located at _www/html/index.html_.

This directory is self-sufficient. It may be copied to a web server as is,
or you may browse it offline (e.g., via 'firefox html/index.html').

To remove the generated files, use 'make clean' from within the www/
directory.


About the web version
=====================

This is probably just a prototype. Known bugs / problems / missing features:
* API references are only simple hyperlinks to the corresponding header files
  on GitHub.
* Various hacks are used. Unexpected input might break something.
* Minor HTML bugs, e.g., broken footnotes

All links across the HTML documents are relative, but they assume a preserved
directory structure. So you can put all files as a whole into subdirectories as
long as you don't change the internal file structure.
