This directory contains the document source for the PDF version of the
Sculpt OS documentation, the HTML version hosted at genode.org, as well
as the README shipped with the Sculpt image.

The genode.org content is generated from a copy of sculpt.txt mirrored at
_repos/gems/recipes/sculpt/README_ in the Genode repository. When modifying
the source, keep in mind to stay compatible with gosh's HTML backend.
In particular, don't insert any LaTeX code.

To keep .png files reasonably small, please always use the 'pngquant'
utility as a post-processing step.
