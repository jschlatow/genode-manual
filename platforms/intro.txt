Introduction
############

This document complements the Genode Foundations book with
low-level hardware-related topics. It is primarily intended for integrators
and developers of device drivers. Before studying the Genode Platforms
material, it is highly recommended to give the Genode Foundations book a read.
The book can be downloaded at [https://genode.org].

In this first edition, the document features a practical guide for the steps
needed to bring Genode to a new ARM SoC. The content is based on the ongoing
Pine Fun article series at [https://genodians.org - Genodians.org].
Note that the document is not set in stone. We plan to continuously extend it
with further practical topics as we go.
